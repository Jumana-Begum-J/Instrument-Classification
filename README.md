# Instrument-Classification

Musical Information Retrieval is the interdisciplinary science of retrieving information from music. It is a new field of research; its objective is extracting data and metadata from musical recordings. Effective audio processing can improve speed, reduce errors, and sometimes increase the accuracy of detecting the musical instrument. One of the main tools used for classification tasks in recent years is deep learning. The three deep learning techniques proposed here are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network – LSTM (RNN-LSTM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN).

# DATASET

Musical Instrument Classification based on Audio Samples.
●	The dataset has 1,020 audio samples of 10 seconds each which are classified into 17 musical instruments.
●	The dataset is balanced (60 samples for each instrument).
